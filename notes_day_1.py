# What is an "array"?
# -A data structure that allocates a certain amount of memory for storage
#  of its items.
# -Integers require 4 bytes each.
#    -1 byte = 8 bits
#    -1 kilobyte = 1,000 bytes = 8,000 bits
#    -1 megabyte = 1,000,000 bytes = 8,000,000 bits
#    -1 gigabyte = 1,000,000,000 bytes = 8,000,000,000 bits

# "Memory is cheap; computation is expensive"
# -Using memory so that you don't have to compute is smart
